# 👋 Welcome to Collexa

**Connect. Code. Grow.**

Collexa is a community-driven tech hub based in Egypt, bridging the gap between different tech silos—from **Networks & DevSecOps** to **Software Development & AI**.

We believe in "learning by doing." This organization is the home of our **Open Projects** initiative, where members from all disciplines collaborate to build real-world, open-source tools.

### 🚀 What We Do
* **Open Source:** We build tools that help the community (CV Builders, Automation Scripts, Network Scanners).
* **Cross-Functional:** Our projects require collaboration between Backend, Frontend, QA, and Ops.
* **Mentorship:** Seniors review Juniors' PRs to help them grow.

### 👩‍💻 How to Contribute
1.  Check out our **Pinned Repositories** below.
2.  Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.
3.  Fork the repo, write your code, and open a PR!
